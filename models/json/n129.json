It can be found swimming in seas, lakes, rivers and shallow puddles.","Gold":"An underpowered, pathetic POKéMON. It may jump high on rare occasions, but never more than seven feet.","Silver":"For no reason, it jumps and splashes about, making it easy for predators like PIDGEOTTO to catch it mid-jump.","Crystal":"This weak and pathetic POKéMON gets easily pushed along rivers when there are strong currents.","Ruby":"MAGIKARP is a pathetic excuse for a POKéMON that is only capable of flopping and splashing. This behavior prompted scientists to undertake research into it.","Sapphire":"MAGIKARP is virtually useless in battle as it can only splash around. As a result, it is considered to be weak. However, it is actually a very hardy POKéMON that can survive in any body of water no matter how polluted it is.","FireRed":"It is virtually worthless in terms of both power and speed. It is the most weak and pathetic POKéMON in the world.","LeafGreen":"In the distant past, it was somewhat stronger than the horribly weak descendants that exist today.","Emerald":"Its swimming muscles are weak, so it is easily washed away by currents. In places where water pools, you can see many MAGIKARP deposited there by the flow.","Diamond":"It is said to be the world’s weakest Pokémon. No one knows why it has managed to survive.","Pearl":"It is unable to swim against even slow-moving currents. It always splashes about for some reason.","Platinum":"A MAGIKARP living for many years can leap a mountain using Splash. The move remains useless, though.","HeartGold":"An underpowered, pathetic Pokémon. It may jump high on rare occasions, but usually not more than seven feet.","SoulSilver":"For no reason, it jumps and splashes about, making it easy for predators like PIDGEOTTO to catch it mid-jump.","BlackWhiteBlack 2White 2":"A Magikarp living for many years can leap a mountain using Splash.

However, it is actually a very hardy Pokémon that can survive in any body of water no matter how polluted it is.","Sun":"Although weak and helpless, this Pokémon is incredibly fertile. They exist in such multitudes, you’ll soon grow tired of seeing them.","Moon":"Its reckless leaps make it easy pickings for predators. On the bright side, many Pokémon enjoy longer life spans, thanks to Magikarp."},"moves":{"byLevelUp":[{"Level":"1","Name":"Splash","Type":"Normal","Category":"status","Power":"—","Accuracy":"—"},{"Level":"15","Name":"Tackle","Type":"Normal","Category":"physical","Power":"40","Accuracy":"100"},{"Level":"30","Name":"Flail","Type":"Normal","Category":"physical","Power":"—","Accuracy":"100"}],"byEgg":[],"byTutor":[{"Name":"Bounce","Type":"Flying","Category":"physical","Power":"85","Accuracy":"85"}],"byTM":[]},"location":{"RedBlueYellow":["Route 4, 6, 10, 11, 12, 13, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, Celadon City, Pallet Town"],"GoldSilver":["Route 6, 9, 10, 12, 13, 19, 20, 21, 22, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 30, 31, 32, 34, 35, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, Blackthorn City, Cerulean City, Cherrygrove City, Cianwood City, Cinnabar Island, Dark Cave, Dragon's Den, Ecruteak City, Fuchsia City, Ilex Forest, Lake of Rage, Mt.
